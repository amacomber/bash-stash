<H1>dockutil installer</H1>

An installer in shell script format for <b>dockutil</b> and setting preferences.

Note some Apple Apps reside in "/System/Applications/" though not all. You can see some examples of this in the <b>example_dockutil_log.txt</b> file.

You will need to copy and paste the link for the latest release of <b>dockutil</b> into the script (all the info you need is inside the comments) before you run it.
