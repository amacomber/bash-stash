Steak Prep

• Preheat oven to 400°

• Season steaks with salt, pepper, and garlic on all sides. I use “Kinders – The Blend”. Just salt and pepper is fine.

• In a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, put in some EVOO. When oil is just about to smoke, add steak.

• Cook for 2m 30 seconds on the two sides, set a timer. Then cook for 1m on each edge.

• As a bonus step, I get frozen garlic and herb butter from Kroger, where I slice off a chunk and put it on the steak before it goes into the oven, but you can also make your own, Google Steak butter for recipes. 

• Transfer the skillet right to the oven and cook until for 5m for medium rare. if you don’t like medium rare, shame on you.

• Remove from pan and let rest 5min
